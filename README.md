# TempLogPlotter
This code, plot temperature against time, it is part of a Temperature Stress Test applied to Aircraft products.

 Key Achievements:

    - Repurposed Existing Equipment: Utilized an old temperature logger with SD card recording capabilities.
    - Custom Software Development: Created a Python and Tkinter application to process and plot the data.
    - Rapid Deployment: Completed development and documentation in just three days.
    - Cost-Effective Solution: Delivered a functional system at zero cost, leveraging existing resources.
    - Certified and Calibrated: Ensured the device is certified and can be calibrated by third-party labs.

Impact: This solution not only saved us significant costs but also ensured uninterrupted testing processes, improving our operational efficiency and reliability.

I encourage everyone to share their own stories of innovation and resourcefulness in the face of challenges. Together, we can inspire and learn from each other!

Je tiens à remercier tous ceux qui ont contribué par leurs connaissances et leurs bibliothèques python à la création de ce script. Il est vrai que je les ai intégrées pour construire un outil spécifique, mais cela n'aurait pas été possible sans leur aide.
